> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Please disable SIP before running the setup script.

Before everything, shut down your Mac and hold the power button for a while to boot into recovery mode.

Then, run the following command to disable SIP:

```bash
csrutil disable
```

Then, intall nvm if needed.

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash
```

Then, pull the repo and enter the folder

```bash
git clone git@github.com:BiboyQG/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles
```

Next, we run the setup script

```bash
zsh setup.sh
```

This will:

- Symlink the dotfiles into place (via `stow --adopt`)
- Install dependencies via Homebrew

### Tips

#### yabai

You need to manually add the following line into `sudo visudo /etc/sudoers`:

```
Defaults	env_keep += "TERMINFO"
```

#### Start services

```bash
brew services start sketchybar
skhd --restart-service
sudo yabai --load-sa
```

#### tmux

Some tmux behavior in this repo is optimized for “session slots” (fast switching / moving windows):

- Sessions are auto-renamed to `<index>-<label>` (example: `1-dot`, `2-spreadsheet-build`)
- Rename the current session label with `<prefix> + .` (the prompt omits the numeric prefix)
- Create a new session with `Ctrl+s` (keeps numbering contiguous)
- Switch sessions with `F1..F10` (in Kitty, `⌘1..⌘0` sends `F1..F10` to tmux)
- Move the current window to session slot with `<prefix> + 1..0`

Shell helpers:

- `ta <label>` attaches by label (example: `ta dot` attaches to `1-dot`)
- `ta <idx>` attaches by slot (example: `ta 1`)
- `tls` lists sessions

#### zsh

`Ctrl+s` is bound in tmux, so XON/XOFF is disabled in interactive shells to avoid terminal “freezing”.

#### Ollama LaunchAgent Setup

To ensure a good experience in WeChat auto reply, we made Ollama serve start automatically at boot and restart on crashes.

To stop the service: `launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ollama.serve.plist`

You are all set!
